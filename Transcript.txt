Good [morning/afternoon], everyone.
My name is Abdul Mannan Saipi, and together with Bhara Alfhaniawan and I Made Raditya Bayu Pangestu, 

Today, we’d like to introduce you to our proposal:
“Smart Retail Without Cashier” – an AI-based retail innovation designed to eliminate queues and simplify the checkout process. 
Our goal is to drive greater efficiency in Indonesia’s digital economy by transforming the retail experience with technology.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me start with a familiar scene we’ve all experienced—long checkout lines.

Whether it’s after work or during the weekend rush, standing in a queue just to pay for groceries is something none of us enjoy.
And while it might seem like just a small inconvenience, this everyday experience actually reflects a deeper problem in the retail sector.

This brings us to the problem we’re tackling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On average, checkout takes 6 to 10 minutes per customer.
Now imagine that multiplied by hundreds of customers every day—
That’s not just lost time for shoppers; it’s also a major operational cost for businesses.

Retailers rely on manual scanning and human cashiers, which leads to:

Long queues and customer frustration

Higher staffing costs

And missed sales due to abandoned purchases

In short, traditional checkout is slow, expensive, and not scalable.

To fully understand the opportunity, we need to break down the true cost of today’s checkout process.

Yes, it’s convenient in theory—but in practice, it’s full of inefficiencies.

First, there’s lost time and frustration.
Customers waiting in long lines often become impatient. Many walk away without buying anything, especially during peak hours. That’s lost revenue.

Next, there’s the high operational overhead.
Retailers spend a significant amount on cashier staffing—costs that directly eat into profits.

And finally, missed opportunities.
Manual processes are difficult to scale, and they slow down the adoption of digital tools, making it harder for retailers to evolve in the digital economy.

The bottom line: traditional checkout isn’t just slow—it’s holding the industry back.
But what if we could eliminate the queue entirely?
That’s exactly what our innovation aims to do.

Here’s our answer:
A cashierless smart retail system powered by AI and computer vision.

With our system, customers simply enter the store, pick up the items they want, and walk out.
No scanning. No standing in line. No waiting.

Behind the scenes, computer vision technology identifies the products taken and links them to the customer’s account. Payment is processed automatically.

It’s a checkout experience that feels like magic—but it’s powered by solid, real-time AI tracking.

This is retail, reimagined: seamless, efficient, and built for today’s digital-native customers.

Beyond solving a retail pain point, our solution delivers strategic business impact.

It aligns with Bank Indonesia and OJK’s vision for a cashless society and supports the adoption of QRIS and digital transformation.

For businesses, it means:

Reduced overhead costs, thanks to automation

Improved customer experience, leading to stronger brand loyalty

And deeper analytics, empowering smarter decision-making

Ultimately, this isn’t just a tech innovation—it’s a step forward for Indonesia’s digital economy.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Behind this seamless customer experience is a robust and scalable technology stack.

At the core of our system is advanced AI/ML:

We use YOLOv8 for real-time object detection

And DeepSORT for multi-object tracking—this ensures that every item picked is accurately identified and linked to the correct user

Next, we enhance accuracy with sensor fusion—combining weight sensors and computer vision to confirm purchases precisely, reducing false detections.

For the user interface, we’ve built an intuitive kiosk using React and Tailwind, providing a smooth fallback experience for cases when manual confirmation is needed.

Our AI models are built using Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, with OpenCV for image processing.

This tech stack doesn’t just work—it’s built to scale and perform reliably in high-traffic retail environments.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s visualize the transformation.

Traditional retail relies on manual item scanning, resulting in:

Long queues

Cashier dependency

And high operational overhead

It’s inefficient, error-prone, and limits scalability.

Now compare that to our smart retail system:

Automated, real-time tracking replaces scanning

Staff-less checkout reduces labor costs and human error

And lower overhead enables businesses to scale operations while improving the customer journey

It’s a complete shift—from reactive to intelligent, from manual to seamless.

Thank you for your time and attention.

We believe that Smart Retail Without Cashier is more than just a hackathon idea—it’s a strategic innovation that aligns with national goals and 
brings real value to both businesses and consumers.

We’re excited about the potential of this solution, and we’re eager to hear your feedback and questions.

Terima kasih.
